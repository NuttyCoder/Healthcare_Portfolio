Project: Heart Disease Prediction with Python
Description
Use the UCI Heart Disease dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient is at risk of heart disease. The project covers the full workflow: data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering, model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors), and model evaluation.

Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (303 patients, 14 features)

Features include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG results, max heart rate, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, slope, number of vessels, thalassemia, and target (presence or absence of heart disease).

Skills Demonstrated
Data loading and preprocessing with pandas

Exploratory Data Analysis (visualization with matplotlib/seaborn)

Handling missing values and outliers

Feature engineering and selection

Implementation of classification models using scikit-learn

Model evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC

Interpretation and visualization of results
